# 🚀 Digital Independence Day Workshop

Part of the Science in the City Festival - Single-participant learning environments for hands-on Co-op Cloud deployment practice.

[Slides](https://git.dailysh.it/nextlevelshit/malta-slides)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start local VM for development/testing
make vm

# 2. Build USB drives for participants
make usb-build
make usb-flash USB_DEVICE=/dev/sdX

# 3. Test your USB build
make usb-test
```

## 🎯 Learning Flow

### Local Practice (USB/VM)
```bash
setup                      # REQUIRED: Setup local proxy first!
recipes                    # Show available apps
deploy wordpress           # Deploy locally
browser wordpress          # Open directly in Firefox
```

### Local Practice Only
```bash
# Focus on local development and testing
# All deployment happens locally on your USB/VM
```

## 🗃️ Architecture

**Single Participant Model**: Each environment (USB/VM) is complete and self-contained.

- **USB Boot**: Bootable NixOS with Docker + abra for hands-on learning
- **Local VM**: Identical environment for development/testing  
- **Local Environment**: Self-contained workshop environment
- **Wildcard DNS**: `*.workshop.local` resolves to `127.0.0.1` via dnsmasq

## 💾 USB Environment

Pre-configured with:
- **Automatic WiFi connection** to workshop network
- Docker Swarm + abra installation
- SSH client for cloud access
- Wildcard DNS resolution (dnsmasq)
- Terminal-first interface (`desktop` command for GUI)
- Helper commands: `recipes`, `deploy`, `browser`, `help`
- Tab completion for all commands

Build and flash:
```bash
make usb-build
make usb-flash USB_DEVICE=/dev/sdb
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

Test your workshop environment:

```bash
make usb-test      # Test ISO in QEMU
make status-local  # Check local services
```

## 🖥️ Local Development

```bash
make vm             # Start VM (simulates USB environment)
make usb-build      # Build ISO to ./build/iso/
make usb-test       # Test ISO in QEMU
```

The VM simulates the USB experience with identical configuration and commands.

**Build Locations:**
- **USB ISOs**: `./build/iso/result/iso/*.iso`
- **VM builds**: `./result/` (Nix default)

## 📚 Enhanced Commands

**In USB/VM environments**:
- `setup` - **REQUIRED FIRST**: Setup local DNS proxy
- `recipes` - Show complete Co-op Cloud catalog
- `deploy <app>` - Deploy locally with tab completion
- `browser [app]` - Launch Firefox [to specific app]
- `install` - Repair abra installation if needed

- `desktop` - Start GUI session
- `help` - Show all commands and debug info

**Examples**:
```bash
# Deploy and open WordPress
deploy wordpress
browser wordpress           # Opens http://wordpress.workshop.local in Firefox

# Just open browser
browser                     # Opens Firefox with blank page

# Use tab completion
deploy <TAB>               # Shows all available recipes
browser <TAB>              # Shows deployed applications
```

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Nix with flakes enabled
- 2GB+ RAM for VM testing
- USB drive (8GB+) for workshop distribution
- SSH key at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (for cloud deployment only)

## 📖 Documentation

- [Manual Network Setup](docs/MANUAL_NETWORK_SETUP.md)
- [USB Boot Instructions](docs/USB_BOOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## 🛠️ Development Tools

```bash
# Format Nix files
make format         # Format Nix files

# Start development environment
make opencode       # Start opencode in dev shell
```

## 🧹 Cleanup

```bash
make clean         # Clean build artifacts (./build/ and ./result/)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check WiFi connection (should connect automatically)
nmcli connection show --active

# Check abra installation
sudo abra --version

# Repair abra installation
install

# Check abra service status
sudo systemctl status workshop-abra-install

# Check DNS resolution
dig @127.0.0.1 test.workshop.local

# Check running services
docker service ls

# Check DNS service
systemctl status dnsmasq

# Restart if needed
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```
